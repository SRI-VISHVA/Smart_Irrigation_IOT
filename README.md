# Machine Learning Powered, An IOT smart farming system 

### The Internet of Things (IoT) can enable us to create applications for crop growth monitoring, irrigation decision support, etc. A Smart Farming system is proposed to modernize and improve the productivity of the crop. Our project idea consists of a soil Irrigation system that takes into account the moisture in the soil and rainfall that land will receive and predicts the water needed to be irrigated in that area. Secondly, we will attempt to predict whether the crop is ready for harvest or not.
